## Usage

Using LAZERBEAM is straightforward. Once you have installed the script, you can execute it with the following command:

```bash
./lazerbeam.sh [options]
```

### Options

- `--source`: Specify the source directory (iPhone photos).
- `--destination`: Specify the destination directory (where you want to back up the photos).
- `--help`: Display help information.

Example:

```bash
./lazerbeam.sh --source /run/user/1000/gvfs/iphone/Photos --destination ~/PhotosBackup
```

## Configuration

Before using LAZERBEAM, you may want to configure some options. You can create a configuration file named `config.cfg` in the same directory as the script. Hereâ€™s an example of what it might look like:

```ini
[source]
path=/run/user/1000/gvfs/iphone/Photos

[destination]
path=~/PhotosBackup
```

You can then run the script without specifying the source and destination:

```bash
./lazerbeam.sh
```
